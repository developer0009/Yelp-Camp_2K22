when we create passport first we need to require passport mongoose
then we have to provide additional information and then we 
can use passportLocalMongoose and then plugin in to the given schema
and then we have add initialize and session 
and all of those things
the main thing is
UserModel.register(userSchema,password)
passport.authenticate('local',{failureFlash:true, failureRedirect:'path'})
adds userId to the session
after this
req.isAuthenticate()
returns true if the userId is present in the session
req.user returns full userobject
and 
req.logout()
destroys the session
req.login(adds to the session)
